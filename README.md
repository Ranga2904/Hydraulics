# Introduction
This repository contains code and associated files supporting a Medium blog post on applying time series forecasting to predict the condition of hydraulic systems using publicly available data from the UCI ML repository. Please visit the blog post for details.

The first of two articles and the LSTM-ML notebook contain applications of:
- feature extraction and selection using tsfresh packages
- modeling using LSTMs and ensemble gradient
- deploying with Flask
