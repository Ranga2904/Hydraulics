# Introduction
This repository contains code and associated files supporting a Medium blog post on applying time series forecasting to predict the condition of hydraulic systems using publicly available data from the UCI ML repository. Please visit the blog post [here](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/time-series-forecasting-building-and-deploying-models-f647c2ec7567)
Part 2 of the series is [here](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/time-series-forecasting-building-and-deploying-models-continued-deee0588b28c)


These blogs and posted notebooks apply:
- feature extraction and selection using tsfresh packages
- modeling using LSTMs and ensemble gradient
- deploying with Flask
- modeling with ARIMA and H20.ai's Auto ML
